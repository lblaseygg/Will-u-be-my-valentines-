# Valentine's Envelope

A fun interactive web project where you can open and close a virtual envelope to reveal a cute love letter. Users can interact with the envelope by clicking "Yes" or "No" to send a response. When they click "Yes", they are redirected to a special "Yes" page, and if they click "No", they are redirected to a "No" page.

### Features:
- **Interactive Envelope**: Open and close the envelope with smooth animations.
- **Love Letter**: A cute love letter slides out of the envelope when opened.
- **Buttons**: Clicking the "Yes" or "No" buttons sends a response and redirects the user to different pages.
- **Responsive Design**: The project is fully responsive and adapts to different screen sizes.
- **GIF Integration**: Custom GIFs for the "Yes" and "No" pages.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites:
- A modern web browser (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, etc.)
- A text editor (VSCode, Sublime Text, etc.) for code customization

### Installation:
1. Clone this repository to your local machine:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/valentine-envelope.git
    ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
    ```bash
    cd valentine-envelope
    ```
3. Open the `index.html` file in your browser to view the project.

## How It Works
1. **Envelope Opening and Closing**:
   The envelope's flap opens and closes with a smooth transition when you click the "Open üíå" and "Close ‚ùå" buttons.
   
2. **Letter Animation**:
   When the envelope opens, a letter slides up from inside the envelope to reveal the text. When the envelope is closed, the letter slides back down and is hidden.

3. **Yes/No Interaction**:
   When you click "Yes! üíò", the page redirects to the `yes.html` page, and when you click "No üò¢", it redirects to the `no.html` page.

## Customization
You can customize the project by:
- Changing the text in the love letter (located in the `index.html` file).
- Replacing the "Yes" and "No" GIFs in the `images/` folder.
- Modifying the styles in `styles.css` to fit your desired color scheme and layout.

## Technologies Used
- **HTML5**: Structure of the project.
- **CSS3**: Styling and animations (flexbox, transitions).
- **JavaScript**: Interaction logic and button actions.
